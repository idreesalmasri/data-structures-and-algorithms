# Trees


## Challenge
- Create a Node class
- Create a Binary Tree class
Define a method for each of the depth first traversals: 
- pre order
- in order
- post order

Binary Search Tree methodes
add(val) : Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.

Contains(val): Returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

Approach & Efficiency
The best case running time for binary search is O(log(n)), if the binary tree is balanced.
this in add and contains methods.

for preorder and inorder and postorder big o of time  o(n^2)
